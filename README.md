# Industrial Automation & Robotics Labs 🦾

## 📝 About this Repository
This repository is a curated collection of technical projects, lab exercises, and programming logic developed during my formal training in **Advanced Industrial Robotics and Automation**. 

It serves as a testament to my foundational logic in systems engineering, PLC programming, and industrial maintenance, which I am now applying to modern Software Development.

## 📁 What's inside?
- **/PLC_Logic_Practices**: PDF reports and source files for various automation routines (Traffic light control, conveyor belts, etc.).
- **/Schematics_and_Design**: Wiring diagrams and simulation board setups for industrial cabinets.
- **/Coursework_Documentation**: Detailed "Memorias" explaining the step-by-step resolution of engineering problems.

## 🌟 Featured Skills Demonstrated
- **State Machine Design:** Complex logic for sequential processes.
- **Troubleshooting:** Identifying and fixing errors in hardware/software integration.
- **Safety Standards:** Implementing emergency stops and fail-safe routines.

*Note: These projects were developed using industrial standards (Ladder Logic, Function Blocks). I am currently leveraging this analytical mindset to master Python and Full Stack technologies.*
